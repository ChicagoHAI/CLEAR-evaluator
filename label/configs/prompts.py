You are a radiologist reviewing a piece of radiology report to assess the presence of 13 specific medical conditions.

Conditions to Evaluate:
- Cardiomegaly
- Enlarged Cardiomediastinum
- Atelectasis
- Consolidation
- Edema
- Lung Lesion
- Lung Opacity
- Pneumonia
- Pleural Effusion
- Pneumothorax
- Pleural Other
- Fracture
- Support Devices

Each medical condition in the radiology report must be categorized using one of the following labels: "positive", "negative" or "unclear". The criteria for each label are:

1. "positive": The condition is indicated as present in the report.
2. "negative": The condition is indicated as not present in the report.
3. "unclear": The report does not indicate a clear presence or absence of the condition.

The user will provide you with a piece of radiology report as input. Return your results in the exact JSON schema shown below and then wrap that JSON inside `<TASK1>` and `</TASK1>` tags.

```json
{
  "Cardiomegaly": "positive" | "negative" | "unclear",
  "Enlarged Cardiomediastinum": "positive" | "negative" | "unclear",

Always produce `<TASK1>{...}</TASK1>` in your final answer, where `{...}` precisely matches the JSON schema above.


FINDINGS: 
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to ___ at 11:03 a.m.: New feeding tube, without a wire stylet, ends in the mid esophagus just below the level of the carina.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is probably increased in volume, but comparison is difficult because patient is supine on this study, erect on the earlier study today.  Consolidation at both lung bases is probably due to worsening atelectasis but of course pneumonia and large scale aspiration are not excluded.  Patient is rotated to her left which distorts the cardiac silhouette, probably mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The left rib fractures are in various stages of healing.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous and heavily calcified.  No pneumothorax.  Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a very large hydropneumothorax on the right side.  There is compression of the lung parenchyma.  There is also some mediastinal shift to the left side.  The left lung appears well aerated without focal consolidation, pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.  The right base has increased in the size with pleural effusion, however, this may be secondary to patient positioning.  There is a pleural-based catheter at the right base.

FINDINGS: 
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to AP chest on ___ and prior PA and lateral ___: Pulmonary vascular congestion is mild, but persistent.  Relative enlargement of the cardiac silhouette compared to ___ suggests some increase in moderate cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.  If there is pericardial effusion it is probably not hemodynamically significant but that determination would require echocardiography.  Small right pleural effusion which increased between ___ and ___ is stable.  A left pleural abnormality could be due to a combination of pleural thickening and small effusion, is unchanged since ___.  Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead is unchanged in position, tip projecting over the floor of the right ventricle close to the anticipated location of the apex.  No pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest and 2 additional views of the left-sided ribs were obtained.  A BB marker projects over the lateral ninth and ___ left ribs indicating patient's site of concern.  No displaced fracture is seen.  The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There may be very minimal left basilar linear atelectasis/scarring.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No displaced rib fracture seen.

FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.4 cm above the carina and is adequately positioned.  Feeding tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, distal end is out of the radiographic view. Right mid and lower lung and left lower lung opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia have worsened since ___. An coexisting component pulmonary edema is possible.  No other interval changes. Scarring in the right lower lungs and right apical dense pleural thickening are unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are similar.  No pneumothorax.
